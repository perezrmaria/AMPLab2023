# AMPLab2023 (Audio & Music Processing Lab)

Creation of a system for generating music playlists based on the results of audio content analysis. 
I used the MusAV dataset as a music audio collection, extracted music descriptors using Essentia (Task2 file).

In this repository I create a simple user interface to generate playlists based on these descriptors using StreamLit.
